## About The Project

![cluster plot](images/clusters_plot.png)

This project focuses on using advanced natural language processing techniques to extract and cluster frequently asked questions from a company's website. By generating an initial set of 130 potential questions, representing them numerically with pretrained BERT models, calculating their semantic similarity, and applying HDBSCAN clustering, we aim to automate the creation of a comprehensive FAQ section, ultimately improving customer support and enhancing the user experience on the company's website.

## Built With

This project is built with a powerful stack of tools, including :

* [Python]()
* [PyTorch]()
* [SentenceTransformer (BERT Model)]()
* [T-SNE for Dimensionality reduction]()
* [HDBSCAN for Clustering]()
* [Bokeh for Data visualization]()
